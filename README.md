# PRESENTATION: It's Time for HTTP/2

I've been teaching web development since 1996. The core platform languages -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- have evolved over the years with a comfortable regularity. But the underlying transport protocol -- HTTP/1.1 -- has remained steadfastly unchanged for nearly 20 years.

That changed in the summer of 2015 with the introduction of HTTP/2. By the end of 2015, all major browsers offered HTTP/2 support, and most of the major websites (Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) were serving up their content via HTTP/2. Oddly, HTTP/2 doesn't yet seem to be a major topic of discussion among web developers. That's a pity, because HTTP/2 offers a number of compelling features:

* Streaming vs. Request/Response
* Durable connections that offer multiplexing and server-push
* Binary vs. text-based responses
* TLS/HTTPS security by default

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer with ThoughtWorks) discusses the key benefits to upgrading your server to HTTP/2, and the challenges you might face along the way.
